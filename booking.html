                    <p>Sessions are relaxed (but fast-paced), fun, and freeing. 
                    Don't expect any stiff, super-posed shots. Images are real, 
                    spontaneous, and fresh. Once your session is booked, we'll 
                    discuss location, clothing, and the overall feel of the session.</p>
                    
                    <p>These are not your typical portraits and my style is not 
                    for everyone--that's okay. It's important to make sure we are 
                    a good match before booking so that you are all thrilled 
                    with the final images. I love capturing real life moments ... 
                    the silly, spontaneous, and playful ... the loving, serious 
                    and thoughtful.</p>

                    <h2>Working With Children</h2>
                    
                    <p>If you are scheduling a portrait session for your child, 
                    it is best to schedule your portrait session during your 
                    child's happiest time of day so that I can capture the 
                    best pictures. It helps to make sure your child gets 
                    plenty of sleep the night before the session, that nap 
                    time isn't too close to session time and they are well fed. </p>
                        
                    <p>This should be FUN! Don't forget to bring extra diapers, 
                    wipes, snacks, favorite toys and blankets the day of 
                    the session. It is great to bring along your child's 
                    favorite items that make them feel comfortable and bring 
                    out their personality. Just tell them that they are 
                    going to Erika's to play.</p>

                    <h2>Best Time For Newborn Photos</h2>
                
                    <p>Newborns are best photographed between 5-10 days old – 
                    I like to call them “Squishy Pictures” ~ have Dad contact 
                    me when your baby is born and I will see you a few days 
                    after you are home.

                    I can help figure out the best location for your session. 
                    I am open to trying new places! Newborn/baby sessions 
                    can be held in my studio, your home, as well as outdoors, 
                    weather permitting.

                    <h2>What Do We Wear?</h2>
                    <p>When selecting clothing for the session, solid colors are 
                    highly recommended. It is best to avoid busy stripes, prints, 
                    bold patterns, and logos. Trendy colors can date your portrait 
                    and are best avoided as well. Black and pastel colors work well 
                    in black and white portraits. Also keep in mind that long 
                    sleeves are most flattering for adults. Shoes and socks should 
                    be similar tone to the outfit. With children, I like to do bare 
                    feet pictures instead of shoes. But, you can bring along 
                    coordinating shoes if you like. Simply avoid shoes with words 
                    and designs on the bottom, especially for infants not yet walking. 
                    For family portraits, it's best to dress everyone in the same 
                    style, color or mood. All light or all dark tones will make the 
                    image most successful. Several shades of one color can be nice. 
                    Also, simple tan pants or jeans and black shirts are great for 
                    a casual family photo. Bring a variety of outfits with you and 
                    feel free to make as many clothing changes as you like.

                    <p>I really like to see the magic between you and capture your

                    you a unique couple in love. Along those lines, I also like 
                    to see your personalities come through in your attire - get 
                    funky! Bright spots of color, cool Converse and a hip tie,
